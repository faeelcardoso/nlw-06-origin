I got thrilled when I realized what I can do only with pure CSS, it's been fantastic to study and build this project!

What I have seen so far which is new to me:

- hsl css: It's awesome to change only the hue and the whole site shows up with a new color
- Incomoon: A package of icons, with it I can easily use the icons with HTML and CSS, only using class tag
- Swiper lib: A library that helps a lot to build a carousel slider animation
- ScrollRevel lib: A library to animate all the elements as they enter/leave the viewport

I'm not done with this project yet, so excited to keep building it. Thanks, Rocketseat for an awesome team, I've been learning a lot with you!
